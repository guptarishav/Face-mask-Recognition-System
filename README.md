# Face-mask-Recognition-System
Face mask detection system using CNN
In this project I added 4 ipynb files. In the file (Mask Detection _Basic model) i train the model using cnn and also using opencv harcascade to detect the face and got accuracy of 99% in 50 epoches. In the 2nd file (Transfer_learning_mass detection_Training) i trained the model using transfer learning and got accuracy off 99% in just 20 epochs.
In 3rd file (Mask recognition on image) i predict the model on random image. For detecting the face(ROI) i used pre trained caffe model.
In 4th file (Mask recognition live) i predict the model on live video stream. For detecting the face(ROI) i used pre trained caffe model. For live video i used python library imutils video stream function.
